# Hand Written Digit Recognition Model
Handwritten digit recognition model using TensorFlow (Neural Networks) and Scikit-learn (SVM)

# The key goals are:
1. To explore distributed hyperparameter tuning using Ray.
2. To compare the performance of Neural Networks and SVM classifiers on the MNIST dataset.
3. To document and analyze the results, including accuracy and computational efficiency.

# Frameworks Used:
1. TensorFlow
2. Scikit-learn
